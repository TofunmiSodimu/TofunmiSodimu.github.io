#### Bladder Fluid Flowscope, Senior Design Project Fall 2021 – Spring 2022
- Developed the electrical schematic and implemented the circuitry for the device enabling us to measure volumes of 0 – 1000mL with an accuracy of +/- 4mL per our client’s specifications.
- Developed an Arduino program to determine volume based on the voltage signal from the load cell and the density of the fluid, and to display the calculated volume, to the nearest mL, in real time.
- Provided effective leadership for a group of 5 students leading to the successful completion of the project.
- Maintained regular and effective communication between client, team mentor, and team members.
