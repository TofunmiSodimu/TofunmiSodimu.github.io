#### Graduate Teaching Assistant, Intro to Robotics and Perception (CS 3630)
- Collaborated with the course instructor and other TAs on course material design and delivery.
- Assisted in the development and evaluation of student projects and quizzes that tested their understanding of robotics and perception concepts (localization, mapping, machine learning, exploration, control, and kinematics), providing constructive feedback to enhance the quality of final deliverables.
- Guided students in the use of robotics software tools, fostering practical skills in robot programming, sensor integration, and perception algorithms.
- Conducted weekly office hours, providing clarification on concepts that were presented in class.
    
#### Robotics Hardware Test Intern, Smith and Nephew Robotics
- Automated bearing failure tests in SN’s surgical robot’s handpiece, reducing testing time by 80%.
- Implemented ASTM standard F3107-14 to measure the effects of mechanical disturbances and environmental influences on the accuracy of SN’s computer-assisted surgical system (CAS).
- Designed a phantom (standardized measuring object) for the implementation of accuracy tests for SN’s CAS.
- Presented project updates and results, at least once a week, to team members and collaborators to drive project completion and summarized observations/results of projects in engineering reports.
- Placed 4th in a country-wide poster competition for SN interns.

#### Student Research Assistant, Ding Lab
- Developed a Light Sheet Fluorescent Microscopy (LSFM) system with a 2-micron axial resolution, limited risk of photobleaching, and optical sectioning capabilities for cardiac related studies in the neonatal mouse.
- Controlled system using LabVIEW for synchronized stage movement, laser propagation, and image acquisition, enabling us to capture images of the heart in < 1 minute.
- Used image processing software (e.g., Amira, ImageJ) for filtering, stitching, deconvolution, and volume rendering of generated images for ease of visualization and analysis.
- Presented research at the 2021 BMES conference and authored a paper.
